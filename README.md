# Big-Data-Analysis_Variable-and-Model-Selection

It will entail some machine learning techniques in the form of neural networks and classic regression, with data analysis to descide which of the two models perform better and should be used over the other. 

It will also entail a variable selection portion for dimension reduction. I do not cover multicolinearity filteration here but will breifly discuss ways to do so as it is a very important. 

String variables are usually a nightmare so I go over stringbinarisation to work with them. There are different and more -believe it or not- numerical ways to handle them which I will go over in a follow up upload for this project. 

I do not perform multicolinearity check here (they are pacakges to do this in the form VIF) but will create a separate file explaining the concept and clever ways around it when working with big data.

The purpose is to model income (income is the dependant variable)

Result Summary: With a t.test, it was established the Neural Network is better than regression for this data set, considering the techniques used to construct our regression model.
