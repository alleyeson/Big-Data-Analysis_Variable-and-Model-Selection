# Big-Data-Analysis_Variable-and-Model-Selection

##This folder is a model selection and construction project u
## It will encompass data analysis techniques to decide which model is better than the other
##It will also entail a variable selection portion for dimension reduction 
## I do not cover multicolinearity filteration here but will breifly discuss ways to do so 

### I wll cover different ways to handle string/factor variables 
## one way is binarisation (which can become tideous)
## the other is factor dummying which is more straight forward and better datasets with more variables

## Want to model total income 
### They are multiple ways to tackle this problem. 
## We can split the problem to regression of income on only factor and income against numerics and then piece them back together
## OR
## we can do it all together
